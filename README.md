The Customer Appointments Scheduler allows you to easily maintain an index of all your customers as well as the appointments you have with them.

This application was designed for the Langley Consulting Group ("LCG" – a fictitious company), but it can be used by other organizations as long as their database is configured according to [the instructions below](#database-specifications).

## Features

* **Database storage.** The application is designed to be linked to LCG's database, and all appointment and customer records created in the application will be stored in this database. Because of this, all changes made to those records (including deletion) will be reflected in the database.
    
- **Generation of statistical reports.** The application generates three main reports. In order to view these reports,  please click on the "Appointments" button after logging into the application; then, click on the "Statistics" button in the lower left corner of the screen.
	- <ins>Report 1</ins>: The first report displays the number of appointments scheduled, sorted by both type and month.
	- <ins>Report 2</ins>: The second report displays an appointment schedule for each business contact listed in LCG's database.
	- <ins>Report 3</ins>: The third report displays the number of appointments currently scheduled for each customer; this list is in descending order.

* **Automatic time zone detection.** The time zone of the user is automatically detected, and all dates and times within the application are displayed in the user's time zone.
	
* **Automatic language translation.** The entire application automatically translates to French if it detects that the user of the application is currently in a French-speaking locale.
	
* **Record of all login attempts.** All login attempts are recorded in the file named "login_activity.txt". The details of these attempts are also recorded, including whether the attempt was successful or unsuccessful, the username used during the login attempt, and the date and time the attempt occurred.

* **Upcoming appointment notifications.** After the user logs into the application, a notification appears informing the user whether or not they have an appointment within the next fifteen minutes; if they do, the details of those appointment(s) are listed.
	
* **Overlapping appointment protection.** If a user attempts to schedule an appointment for a customer who already has an appointment during the specified timeframe, the application warns the user of this and does not allow the appointment to be scheduled.
	
* **Awareness of business hours.** If a user attempts to schedule an appointment outside of LCG's business hours (currently 8 AM to 10 PM EST), the application warns the user of this and does not allow the appointment to be scheduled.
	
* **Extensive code documentation.** The application code includes detailed Javadoc comments above every class, method, and variable, and there are even more detailed (non-Javadoc) comments explaining certain snippets of code; this comprises extensive and easily-understandable documentation.
	
* **Many other features.** The application includes many other features and error-checking attributes that have not been named here.

	</details>
    </li>
    <li>
        A popup window will appear. On this popup window, click the "Browse" button that appears next to the "ZIP File:" label (see image below).<p></p>
	Now, navigate through your local directories to find the ZIP file that you downloaded in step 1. Open and then import this ZIP file.<p></p>

	</details>
    </li>
    <li>
        Now, you can build the project. To do this, first highlight the project file by clicking on it (see rectangle #1 in the image below). Then, click the "Clean 	     and Build" button (see rectangle #2).<p></p>
	After waiting for the project to finish building, you should see a message in the Output window that says "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" (see rectangle #3).<p></p>
